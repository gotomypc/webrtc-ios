Description:
This consists of three components:
* A partial copy of libjpeg-turbo-1.0.1 with one small additional fix - r324 from
  https://libjpeg-turbo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/libjpeg-turbo/branches/1.0.x
* A build file (libjpeg.gyp), and;
* Patched header files used by Chromium.

This libjpeg-turbo can replace our libjpeg-6b without any modifications in the
Chromium code.

Same as our copy of libjpeg-6b, this libjpeg-turbo also added a new file
jpeglibmangler.h and included it from jpeglib.h that changes the names of all
externally visible functions to chromium_* so that we can avoid conflicts that
arise when system libraries attempt to use our libjpeg. Also, We added the
'private_extern' flags on Mac (or the 'hidden' flags on Linux) to all the
global symbols in '.asm' files to prevent making them external ones.
The 'google.patch' file represents our changes from the original
libjpeg-turbo-1.0.1.
